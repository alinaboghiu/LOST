						Individual Project Progess Log

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
December 4th
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First meeting with my supervisor.
We discussed the main things I should be doing over christmas to get started and end up with a clear idea of what my project will be.

	1. What do I want to do?
	   Teach students first order predicate logic. Assume they know propositinal logic rules and semantics.

	2. How do I want to do it?
	   Provide an attractive and easy to use graphical interface that will guide the student through learning semantics.
	   Put the user into context with the shortest, most catchy introduction
