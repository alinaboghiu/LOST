	2. How do I want to do it?
	3. What tools will I use and why?
			Am I building a graphical usar interface?

In alta ordine de idei I had an idea to make a game where the user can train a robot (or monkey, probably monkey) logic semantics. Then use it to play the hintikka game against other users.

questions that arised (WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING??)
	1. For it to be an attractive multiplayer game it would have to be web based. Consider playing against the computer.
	2. Where do I start? What does the monkey know to begin with?
	3. How does the monkey get taught? The user must know what to teach: 
			recognize constants (objects)
			recognize 
			relations(unary, then binary, then arity N)
		then
