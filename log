First meeting with my supervisor.
We discussed the main things I should be doing over christmas to get started and end up with a clear idea of what my project will be.

	1. What do I want to do?
	   Help students to understand first order predicate logic sytax and semantics. Assume they are familiar with basic concepts.

	2. How do I want to do it?
	   Provide an attractive and easy to use graphical interface that will guide the student through learning semantics.
	   Put the user into context with the shortest, most catchy introduction (e.g. Why do we need predicate logic).
	   Allow user graphical and command line input so that they can play arround easily with variations of a formula
